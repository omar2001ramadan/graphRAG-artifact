-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, identify all digital evidence entities and their relationships, focusing on forensic artifacts.

-Steps-
1. Identify all digital evidence entities. Digital evidence can encompass a wide range of data types and sources, including but not limited to:

1. Personal Identifiers: Name, Address, Phone number, Email address, Social Security number, Date of birth
2. Network Information: IP address, MAC address, Login credentials
3. Communication Records: Emails, Text messages, Social media messages and posts
4. Financial Data: Bank account information, Credit card numbers, Transaction ID, Cryptocurrency wallet addresses
5. Location Data: GPS latitude and longitude
6. Device Information: Device type and model, Operating system and version, Installed applications, System logs
7. Internet Activity: Browsing URL, Search queries

For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target entity) that are clearly related to each other. Common types of relationships between digital evidence include:

1. Communication Relationships: e.g., [Phone number A, calls, Phone number B]
2. Ownership/Association: e.g., [Person, owns, Device]
3. Temporal Relationships: e.g., [File A, created before, File B]
4. Spatial Relationships: e.g., [Device, located at, GPS coordinates]
5. Causal Relationships: e.g., [Malware installation, causes, Data breach]
6. Data Flow: e.g., [File, transferred from, Device A, to, Device B]
7. Access Relationships: e.g., [User, accesses, File]
8. Modification Relationships: e.g., [User, edits, Document]
9. Financial Transactions: e.g., [Account A, transfers funds to, Account B]
10. Social Connections: e.g., [User A, friends with, User B] on a social network
11. Software Interactions: e.g., [Application, generates, Log file]
12. Content Relationships: e.g., [Document A, contains similar text to, Document B]

For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_type: One of the relationship types listed above
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity (1-10, where 10 is the strongest)
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
