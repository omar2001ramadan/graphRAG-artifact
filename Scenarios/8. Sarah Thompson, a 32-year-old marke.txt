Sarah Thompson, a 32-year-old marketing consultant, was traveling when she received a suspicious text message. It claimed to be from her bank, asking her to confirm a recent purchase. Concerned, she clicked the link and entered her login credentials. Later, Sarah noticed her cryptocurrency wallet had been emptied, and her email address, sarah.t@example.com, was being used to send phishing emails. Her device logs revealed that a malicious application had been installed, capturing her IP address, 172.16.254.1, and GPS coordinates while she was connected to a public Wi-Fi network at a caf√©.
