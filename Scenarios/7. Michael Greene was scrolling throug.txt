Michael Greene was scrolling through his emails when he noticed one from his cloud storage provider, alerting him to unusual activity on his account. Someone had uploaded a large number of files from an unfamiliar device. Michaelâ€™s IP address, 10.1.1.1, had been spoofed to make it look like the uploads were coming from his home network. Upon further investigation, he realized that his entire file system had been compromised, including personal documents, photos, and videos that were now being used in a phishing scam targeting his contacts.
