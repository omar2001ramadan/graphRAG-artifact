Tom Jenkins was enjoying his evening when he received a notification that his account had been logged into from a new device. Alarmed, he checked his email and found a series of password reset requests he hadnâ€™t made. His IP address, 172.20.10.3, and MAC address, 02:42:ac:11:00:02, were now being used by the attacker to access his bank accounts and social media profiles. Tom quickly contacted his service providers to lock down his accounts, but not before the hacker had stolen several thousand dollars and posted offensive messages on his social media.
