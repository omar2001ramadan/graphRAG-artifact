Henry Mitchell, a small business owner, received a call from his credit card company about several suspicious transactions. He hadn’t made the purchases, but they were all linked to his business email, henry.m@example.com. Upon checking his device, Henry found that his browser history and saved passwords had been accessed by a malicious extension he unknowingly installed. The attacker had used this information to log into Henry’s online accounts, change his login credentials, and steal his customers’ financial data.
