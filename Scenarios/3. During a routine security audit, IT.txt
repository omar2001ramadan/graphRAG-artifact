During a routine security audit, IT specialist Lisa Brown discovered that an unauthorized user had accessed the companyâ€™s internal network. The intruder had used stolen login credentials to log in from a remote location, masking their true IP address with a VPN. Lisa traced the activity back to a compromised device belonging to an employee who had clicked on a malicious link in a phishing email. The attacker had installed malware that captured system logs and sent them to a command-and-control server.
