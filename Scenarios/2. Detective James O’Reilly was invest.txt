Detective James O’Reilly was investigating a cyber theft case involving millions of dollars. The suspect, identified only by the email address hacker@example.com, had transferred funds from multiple accounts using a sophisticated malware program. Forensic analysis of the suspect’s IP address, 10.0.0.5, and MAC address, 11:22:33:44:55:66, revealed a complex web of transactions involving cryptocurrency wallets and offshore bank accounts. The stolen funds were tracked to a server located in Eastern Europe, but the trail went cold after the hacker used a VPN to cover their tracks.
