Megan Lee, a high school teacher, was surprised when she noticed her students gossiping about her online. Curious, she checked her social media accounts and found someone had posted embarrassing photos of her, complete with geotags that pinpointed her exact location during a recent vacation. Her phoneâ€™s IP address, 192.168.0.2, had been compromised, and an unknown device was now accessing her cloud storage, downloading private files. Megan quickly changed her passwords and enabled two-factor authentication, hoping to regain control of her digital life.
