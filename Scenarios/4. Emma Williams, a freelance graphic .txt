Emma Williams, a freelance graphic designer, received an urgent call from her bank about unusual activity on her account. Someone had used her credit card number to make several large purchases. When Emma checked her recent emails, she noticed a confirmation for a purchase she didnâ€™t make, sent from her compromised email address, emma.w@example.com. A quick scan of her computer revealed a keylogger had been installed, recording every keystroke and sending it to an unknown IP address, 198.51.100.0.
