After a long day at work, Alex Rivera sat down to relax, unaware that his computer had been infected with ransomware. The attacker had gained access through a phishing email disguised as a work-related message, capturing Alexâ€™s login credentials and IP address, 203.0.113.5. As Alex tried to access his documents, a message appeared, demanding payment in cryptocurrency in exchange for the decryption key. The ransomware had encrypted all his important files, and the attacker had even deleted his backups stored in the cloud.
